	FOLDER LOL:
The main idea is creating a game that simulates a battle between a hero and a monster.
The main classes are CharacterClass, which describes the basic properties of the hero
	and FightClass.php - which describes the process of the battle.
Olaf, Malphite - specific classes of characters which are descendants CharacterClass.
After the user's authorization it's going to choose.php, where the hero could be chosen - next to fight.php.
The authorization, registration and recording into DB haven't been completed yet. Here are only the basic logic.

	FOLDER TESTLOL:
covering the main classes with 
- Character:
	- asserts;
	- exception test.
 - DB (testing class that isn't related to the main classes (to the main idea of the game)): 
	- asserts.
- Fight
	- asserts;
	- Mocks;
	- exception tests.
